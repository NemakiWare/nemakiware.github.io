<b>How does your company/organization store content?</b>
</p>
<p>
Documents, scanned papers, emailsâ€¦ your content is <b>growing at exponential speed</b>, and at the same time it must be securely <b>accessible</b> from your anywhere, including your tablet.
</p>

<p>
That's why the future of Enterprise Content Management (ECM) is in <b>scalability and accessibility</b>.<br/>
NemakiWare is an Open Source ECM server that strives to excel in both:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Scalability</b>: Built on CouchDB, a modern database designed to scale horizontally. Need more? Just add more servers.</li>
<li><b>Accessibility</b>: More and more apps support the CMIS standard (Content Management Interoperability Services).</li>
</ul>
